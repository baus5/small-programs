"""The 100 Prisoners Problem

The 100 prisoners problem is a mathematical problem in probability
theory and combinatorics. In this problem, 100 numbered prisoners
must find their own numbers in one of 100 drawers in order to survive.
The rules state that each prisoner may open only 50 drawers and
cannot communicate with other prisoners. At first glance, the situation
appears hopeless, but a clever strategy offers the prisoners a realistic
chance of survival. Danish computer scientist Peter Bro Miltersen first
proposed the problem in 2003.

    The director of a prison offers 100 death row prisoners,
    who are numbered from 1 to 100, a last chance. A room contains a
    cupboard with 100 drawers. The director randomly puts one prisoner's
    number in each closed drawer. The prisoners enter the room, one after
    another. Each prisoner may open and look into 50 drawers in any order.
    The drawers are closed again afterwards. If, during this search, every
    prisoner finds his number in one of the drawers, all prisoners are
    pardoned. If just one prisoner does not find his number, all prisoners
    die. Before the first prisoner enters the room, the prisoners may
    discuss strategy â€” but may not communicate once the first prisoner enters
    to look in the drawers. What is the prisoners' best strategy?"""
